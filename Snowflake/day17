 ============================================ ZERO COPY CLONING ===========================================================

-- “zero-copy cloning” creates a copy of a database, schema, or table. 
-- A snapshot of data present in the source object is taken when the clone is created, and is made available to the cloned object.
-- The cloned object is writable and is independent of the clone source.

// ADVANTAGES OF ZERO-COPY CLONING 
 -- Zero Copy Cloning saves you on Storage costs 
 -- Any DML update to the cloned table will not affect the source object.
 -- Saves your Time: You usually have to wait hours, days, or even weeks to create a test or development environment
